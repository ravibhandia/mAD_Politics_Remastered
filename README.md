Data collected from the above sources is manipulated for this project. We dropped
some information we deemed irrelevant for this project. We also manipulated it in order
to make it easier and also for demonstration purposes. You can take a look at ```clean_data.ipynb```.
The data is processed in clean_data and is exported to csv file. The output is then bulkloaded
into the database using queries in Mad_politics.sql
